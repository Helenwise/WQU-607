# WQU-607
Code from WQU607, Algorithms 1, for WorldQuant University

This course covers the basic concepts of Algorithms. Students will learn about algorithms and their
role in computing. They will examine data structures, recursion and sorting and searching. They will
then look at different algorithms like tree algorithms, graph algorithms, greedy algorithms and
numerical algorithms.
